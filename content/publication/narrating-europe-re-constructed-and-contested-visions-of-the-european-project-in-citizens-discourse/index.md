abstract: Changes in public opinion and civil society over the last decade have
  shown that citizens, particularly in old EU Member States, have developed more
  complex attitudes towards European integration. While the European project was
  previously generally described as a teleological depoliticized project, aiming
  at building peace and comforting growth, different competing visions of the
  European project are nowadays acknowledged and surface among the public on
  occasions, like referendums or treaty negotiations. While EU official
  narratives are documented by studies on the European institutions or the
  visions of leaders and parties, their empirical analysis at the citizens'
  level is still fragmented. Using focus group data in four countries (France,
  Portugal, Italy and Belgium) and three social groups (21 group interviews), we
  provide a comparative qualitative answer to how citizens envision European
  integration. Our results show that, first, official narratives do not fail to
  reach citizens, but they are also loosened, contested, and do not
  systematically produce a sense of common belonging. Second, they highlight the
  importance of socio-economic contexts, as well as national and personal
  experience in the re-appropriation of these narratives.
